  # Weather Dashboard

  ## Description
  A weather dashboard which displays current weather and forecast for a searched city. Users can search for a city, and if found the app will return the current weather, as well as a forecast of the next 5 days. The user's search history is saved as a button for them to quickly check the weather of that city again.
